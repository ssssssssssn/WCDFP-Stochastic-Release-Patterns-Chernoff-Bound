# WCDFP-Stochastic-Release-Patterns-Chernoff-Bound

This repository is used to reproduce the evaluation from paper: WCDFP Analysis for Real-Time Tasks with Stochastic Release Patterns using Chernoff Bound for RTSS 2025 submission. Specifically, Fig. 2(a)-(h) in Section V.

As the image file exceeds GitHubâ€™s upload size limit, we are unable to provide it directly in this repository. Instead, we have prepared a separate download instruction file[Download-win10.ova](https://github.com/ssssssssssn/WCDFP-Stochastic-Release-Patterns-Chernoff-Bound/blob/main/Download-win10.ova.md). If you intend to use VirtualBox, please follow the instructions in this document to obtain and install the image.We have already set up the environment in the virtual machine. Please use VSCode to run our code. Both our code and VSCode are provided on the desktop, and you can directly use VSCode to run the experiments by following the instructions in [How to run the experiments](https://github.com/ssssssssssn/WCDFP-Stochastic-Release-Patterns-Chernoff-Bound/blob/main/StochasticReleasePatterns_VSCodeVersion/README.md#how-to-run-the-experiments)
