# Download documentation

**Since the image file exceeds GitHubâ€™s upload size limit, it cannot be provided directly within this repository. If you plan to use VirtualBox, please follow the steps below to download and extract the compressed archive in order to obtain the image:**

1. **Download the split archive files.**Make sure both files from the links below are fully downloaded and **placed in the same directory.**

- [win10.7z.001](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Hfrer4fi7PDmwIpN6ouTQYB8-bU7xzB/view?usp=sharing)   

- [win10.7z.002](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16UGpctDxaU6CpRELwOuQKZ7H2IxHliIl/view)

2. **Extract the files.**To obtain the image file, simply extract `win10.7z.001`. The extraction tool will automatically merge and unpack all parts to generate the VirtualBox image. We recommend using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or any compatible extraction program.

**After extraction, you should obtain a `.ova` file, which can be directly imported into VirtualBox.**
